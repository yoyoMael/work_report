#Abstract

>
*Internet traffic classification has become a crucial for the existing network system. Furthermore, we have witnessed the efficiency of machine learning technique in this domain. In the study, an ensemble machine learning algorithm is deployed to distinguish imbalanced Internet traffic. Light Gradient Boosting Machine(LightGBM), an efficient ensemble machine learning model has been applicated and proved to acquire significant advantage to the other algorithms. Besides, resampling techniques were used to abate the bias of LightGBM. Without port number or IP information, the implemented method could achieve an increase of more than 10% for the recall minority traffic flow, and in the meanwhile maintain an accuracy over 99%*
